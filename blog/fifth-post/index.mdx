Key Points:
Superset of JavaScript: TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types, but any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.
Static Typing: By providing type annotations, TypeScript can perform static type checking, helping to find errors at compile time rather than runtime.
Enhanced IDE Support: The use of types improves code editor tooling, such as autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring, making development more efficient.
Transpilation: TypeScript code is transpiled into plain JavaScript, which can then be run in any environment that supports JavaScript.
