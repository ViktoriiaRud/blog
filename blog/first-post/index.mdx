Key Points:
Dynamic Content: JavaScript can change the content on a webpage without needing to reload the whole page.
Interactive: It enables user interactions like button clicks, form submissions, and mouse movements.
Versatile: Works on the client-side (in the browser) but can also be used on the server-side with environments like Node.js.
Integration: Often used alongside HTML and CSS to create web pages and applications.
