Key Points:
Component-Based: React is built around the concept of components, which are self-contained pieces of UI that can be reused and combined to create complex user interfaces.
Declarative: With React, you describe how your UI should look at any given point in time, and React automatically updates the UI when the underlying data changes.
Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the real DOM by only changing what needs to be changed, leading to improved performance.
