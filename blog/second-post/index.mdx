Structure: It provides the basic structure of web pages, which is then enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
Elements: HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. Examples include headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.
Simple to Learn: Basic HTML is easy to learn and essential for anyone who wants to create web pages.
