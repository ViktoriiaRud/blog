Key Points:
React Framework: Next.js is built on top of React, providing all the benefits of React components and hooks.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR): It allows for server-side rendering, which means pages are generated on the server for better performance and SEO.
Static Site Generation (SSG): It also supports static site generation, allowing pages to be pre-rendered at build time.
API Routes: Next.js enables developers to create API endpoints directly within the application.
Routing: It comes with a built-in file-based routing system, making it easy to create and navigate between pages.
Fast Refresh: Provides fast refresh during development, which makes the development process faster and more efficient.
