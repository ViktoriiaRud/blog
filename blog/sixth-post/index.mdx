Key Points:
React-Based: Gatsby is built on top of React, allowing developers to create components and manage the user interface effectively.
Static Site Generator: It generates static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files during the build process, making the final site extremely fast.
GraphQL Integration: Gatsby uses GraphQL to fetch data from various sources, including Markdown files, CMSs, APIs, and databases, and makes it easy to query and use this data in your components.
Performance Optimizations: Gatsby comes with built-in performance optimizations like code splitting, image optimization, and lazy loading, ensuring that the sites are fast and performant.
