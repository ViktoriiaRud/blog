Key Points:
Style and Layout: CSS specifies how HTML elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
Separation of Content and Design: By separating the content (HTML) from the design (CSS), it allows for easier maintenance and more flexibility in presentation.
Selectors and Properties: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and properties to define how they should be styled.
